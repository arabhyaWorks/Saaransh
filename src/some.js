when the cursor is the let us 0th index, and i click h 
then h got written,(what ideally should happen now it that the cursor should move to the right by 1 index, but it is not happening and the cursor is still at the 0th index)

then i click e, then e got written, on the 0th index on the left of the "h", and the cursor is still at the 0th index
